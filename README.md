#### By Dani Renner

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.NET 5.0.102_
* _ASP.NET Core Mvc 4.8_
* _Razor_

## Description

_This application allows a many-to-many database relationship to hold engineers and machines. This way, the factory is able to see which engineers are licensed in which machines. Both engineers and machines can be added, deleted, and edited._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* You can clone the repository to your desktop
* Open a SQL command line in a terminal. Copy and paste the contents of dani_renner.sql and hit enter.
* Quit out of SQL with Ctrl + c
* Navigate to the Factory directory
* Navigate to the HairSalon directory
* Add a file called appsettings.json. In that file, you will need to add the following code:
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=dani_renner;uid=root;pwd=_password_;"
  }
}

* Save
* Enter "dotnet run" in the terminal and hit enter to start a local host.
